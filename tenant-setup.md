## Multi-Tenancy Architecture in Kubernetes ##

**Concept of multi tenancy**: In kubernetets, multi-tenancy is when multiple users share a single cluster.

I have set up this on my own k8s cluster created in virtual box. Taken one master node and one worker node.

**Master Node IP: 192.168.1.50**

**Worker Node IP: 192.168.1.53**
